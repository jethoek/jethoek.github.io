        <h2> Conceptual and referential activation in discourse </h2>
        <p> <i> with Frederike Weeber & Klaus von Heusinger</i> </p>
        <p>
          This project studies the prominence and accessibility of
          discourse entities. Comparing referential chains
          (a blue car &mdash;  it) and conceptual chains (a blue car &mdash; a red one),
          we test how the prominence of discourse entities is affected by
          subsequent linguistic material, with a specific focus on how
          syntactically subordinated vs coordinated clauses and discourse-structurally
          subordinated vs coordinated clauses affect the accessibility of referents and concepts.
        </p>


        <h2> Pronominalization and predictability</h2>
        <p> <i> with Hannah Rohde & Andrew Kehler</i> </p>
        <p>
          The idea that predictability influences production has been observed at multiple levels of
          linguistic structure, but evidence for the influence of predictability on reduction in
          speakers' choice of reference is mixed. Some studies show more pronominalization for
          more predictable referents, while others find no influence of predictability and instead
          link pronominalization to other factors exclusively related to referent
          topicality. Disentangling these factors is a challenge, as it is difficult to manipulate one
          factor while holding all others constant. In this project, we test pronominalization in contexts
          that permit manipulations of predictability and address prior confounds of referent optionality.

        <h2> Utterance informativity </h2>
        <p> <i> with Hannah Rohde, Maayan Keshev, & Michael Franke </i> </p>
        <p>
          Communication depends in part on the hope that people will tell us things we are interested in
          with language providing a channel by which speakers can convey, among other things, newsworthy
          and informative messages. Despite this, research often emphasizes the role of predictability,
          showing that comprehenders make fast and sophisticated use of knowledge about typical situations
          to shape their expectations about upcoming words in fine-grained and context-driven ways. This
          project contrasts these two dimensions, distinguishing knowledge about situation plausibility
          from knowledge about what people actually choose to talk about.

        <h2> The role of information structure in relative clause processing </h2>
        <p> <i> with Hans Wilke, Hannah Rohde, Bettelou Los, & Antonella Sorace </i> </p>
        <p>
          Relative clause constructions are not all equally easy to process. Prior work on relative clause complexity focuses
          primarily on syntactic explanations for why some relative clauses (e.g., subject-extracted RCs) are easier to process
          than others (e.g., object-extracted RCs). However, syntactic explanations alone fail to make the right predictions of
          comprehenders' processing difficulties. This project investigates the influence of information structure
          on RC processing, focusing specifically of the roles of information status and at-issueness.
        </p>

        <h2> Restrictive relative clauses as discourse segments </h2>
        <p> <i> with Hannah Rohde, Jacqueline Evers-Vermeul, & Ted Sanders </i> </p>
        <p>
          Coherence relations are generally assumed to hold between clauses, but restrictive relative clauses
          are often not granted discourse segment status because they are syntactically and conceptually integrated
          in their matrix clauses. However, a coherence relation can plausibly be inferred in many restrictive relative clause
          constructions. In the headline "Man who attacked jogger in Seattle park sentenced to prison," for instance,
          we not only know <i>who</i> was sentenced to prison, but also <i>why</i> this happened.
          This project investigates the role of restrictive relative clause at the discourse level: do comprehenders
          indeed make such inferences, and if so, how expected are these inferences (i.e., are they associated
          with processing difficulty)?
