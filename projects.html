        <h2> Utterance informativity </h2>
        <p> <i> with Hannah Rohde, Maayan Keshev, & Michael Franke </i> </p>
        <p>
          Communication depends in part on the hope that people will tell us things we are interested in
          with language providing a channel by which speakers can convey, among other things, newsworthy
          and informative messages. Despite this, research often emphasizes the role of predictability,
          showing that comprehenders make fast and sophisticated use of knowledge about typical situations
          to shape their expectations about upcoming words in fine-grained and context-driven ways. This
          project contrasts these two dimensions, distinguishing knowledge about situation plausibility
          from knowledge about what people actually choose to talk about.

        <h2> The role of information structure in relative clause processing </h2>
        <p> <i> with Hans Wilke, Hannah Rohde, Bettelou Los, & Antonella Sorace </i> </p>
        <p>
          Relative clause constructions are not all equally easy to process. Prior work on relative clause complexity focuses
          primarily on syntactic explanations for why some relative clauses (e.g., subject-extracted RCs) are easier to process
          than others (e.g., object-extracted RCs). However, syntactic explanations alone fail to make the right predictions of
          comprehenders' processing difficulties. This project investigates the influence of information structure
          on RC processing, focusing specifically of the roles of information status and at-issueness.
        </p>

        <h2> Subordination and coreference </h2>
        <p> <i> with Timo Buchholz & Klaus von Heusinger</i> </p>
        <p>
          The prominence status of referents in a discourse appears to be influenced
          by syntactic subordination: in configurations with a main clause and a subordinate clause, the
          subject of the second clause is less frequently pronominalized in subsequent discourse than when
          the second clause is also a main clause. However, this effect may not be due to syntactic
          subordination per se, but rather be the result of the relative prominence of the propositions,
          for which syntactic subordination is but one cue. This study investigates how syntactic and
          prosodic cues indicate the level of integration or subordination of clauses in complex sentences
          and thus affect the accessibility of the referents contained within each clause.
        </p>

        <h2> Pronominalization and predictability</h2>
        <p> <i> with Hannah Rohde & Andrew Kehler</i> </p>
        <p>
          The idea that predictability influences production has been observed at multiple levels of
          linguistic structure, but evidence for the influence of predictability on reduction in
          speakers' choice of reference is mixed. Some studies show more pronominalization for
          more predictable referents, while others find no influence of predictability and instead
          link pronominalization to other factors exclusively related to referent
          topicality. Disentangling these factors is a challenge, as it is difficult to manipulate one
          factor while holding all others constant. In this project, we test pronominalization in contexts
          that permit manipulations of predictability and address prior confounds of referent optionality.
